# minefield

In the game, you have go through the grid without stepping on the bomb. You get 5 chances to complete it.

- game starts from the row 1 - 10 and then you need to keep walking untill you pass through


## In the game I have provided 2 ways to play.
* Browser - Just open Index.html in browser and start playing.
* Commandline - Go to node repl. Then `let game = require("./gameForNode.js")` and do `game.startGame()` and start playing via 
commandline.
